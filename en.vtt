00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.190
In this video, I want to
talk about what is easily

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.800
one of the most fundamental and
profound concepts in statistics

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.710
and maybe in all of mathematics.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.360
And that's the
central limit theorem.

00:00:16.624 --> 00:00:18.290
And what it tells us
is we can start off

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.259
with any distribution that
has a well-defined mean and

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:23.300
variance-- and if it has
a well-defined variance,

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.261
it has a well-defined
standard deviation.

00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:27.760
And it could be a continuous
distribution or a discrete one.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.843
I'll draw a discrete one,
just because it's easier

00:00:29.843 --> 00:00:33.000
to imagine, at least for
the purposes of this video.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.480
So let's say I have a discrete
probability distribution

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.430
function.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.806
And I want to be
very careful not

00:00:38.806 --> 00:00:41.138
to make it look anything close
to a normal distribution.

00:00:41.138 --> 00:00:43.570
Because I want to show you
the power of the central limit

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.360
theorem.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.818
So let's say I have
a distribution.

00:00:45.818 --> 00:00:47.775
Let's say it could take
on values 1 through 6.

00:00:47.775 --> 00:00:50.960
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.590
It's some kind of crazy dice.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.192
It's very likely to get a one.

00:00:54.192 --> 00:00:55.566
Let's say it's
impossible-- well,

00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:56.870
let me make that
a straight line.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.828
You have a very high
likelihood of getting a 1.

00:00:58.828 --> 00:01:00.510
Let's say it's
impossible to get a 2.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.058
Let's say it's an OK likelihood
of getting a 3 or a 4.

00:01:03.058 --> 00:01:04.599
Let's say it's
impossible to get a 5.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.990
And let's say it's very
likely to get a 6 like that.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.314
So that's my probability
distribution function.

00:01:10.314 --> 00:01:12.230
If I were to draw a
mean-- this the symmetric,

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.600
so maybe the mean would
be something like that.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.199
The mean would be halfway.

00:01:16.199 --> 00:01:17.740
So that would be my
mean right there.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.180
The standard
deviation maybe would

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.980
look-- it would be
that far and that

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.760
far above and below the mean.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.710
But that's my discrete
probability distribution

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.470
function.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.678
Now what I'm going to do
here, instead of just taking

00:01:28.678 --> 00:01:30.800
samples of this
random variable that's

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.950
described by this probability
distribution function,

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.820
I'm going to take samples of it.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.550
But I'm going to
average the samples

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.450
and then look at
those samples and see

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.670
the frequency of the
averages that I get.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.311
And when I say average,
I mean the mean.

00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:45.310
Let me define something.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.090
Let's say my sample size-- and
I could put any number here.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:57.680
But let's say first off we try a
sample size of n is equal to 4.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.390
And what that means is I'm going
to take four samples from this.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.080
So let's say the first
time I take four samples--

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.760
so my sample sizes is
four-- let's say I get a 1.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.670
Let's say I get another 1.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.380
And let's say I get a 3.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.860
And I get a 6.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.772
So that right there is my
first sample of sample size 4.

00:02:14.772 --> 00:02:16.480
I know the terminology
can get confusing.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.990
Because this is the sample
that's made up of four samples.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.397
But then when we talk about the
sample mean and the sampling

00:02:23.397 --> 00:02:25.230
distribution of the
sample mean, which we're

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.990
going to talk more and more
about over the next few videos,

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.182
normally the sample refers
to the set of samples

00:02:32.182 --> 00:02:33.140
from your distribution.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.810
And the sample size tells
you how many you actually

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.140
took from your distribution.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.370
But the terminology
can be very confusing,

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.370
because you could easily view
one of these as a sample.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.130
But we're taking four
samples from here.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.811
We have a sample size of four.

00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:48.060
And what I'm going to do is
I'm going to average them.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.837
So let's say the mean-- I
want to be very careful when

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:51.420
I say average.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.140
The mean of this first
sample of size 4 is what?

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.140
1 plus 1 is 2.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.100
2 plus 3 is 5.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.640
5 plus 6 is 11.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.080
11 divided by 4 is 2.75.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.300
That is my first sample mean
for my first sample of size 4.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.290
Let me do another one.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:19.230
My second sample of size 4,
let's say that I get a 3, a 4.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.700
Let's say I get another 3.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.750
And let's say I get a 1.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.500
I just didn't happen
to get a 6 that time.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.500
And notice I can't
get a 2 or a 5.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.160
It's impossible for
this distribution.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.800
The chance of getting
a 2 or 5 is 0.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.100
So I can't have any
2s or 5s over here.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.830
So for the second
sample of sample size 4,

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.020
my second sample mean is
going to be 3 plus 4 is 7.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.110
7 plus 3 is 10 plus 1 is 11.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.671
11 divided by 4,
once again, is 2.75.

00:03:49.671 --> 00:03:51.170
Let me do one more,
because I really

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.282
want to make it clear
what we're doing here.

00:03:53.282 --> 00:03:53.990
So I do one more.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.330
Actually, we're going
to do a gazillion more.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.160
But let me just do
one more in detail.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.190
So let's say my third
sample of sample size 4--

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.630
so I'm going to
literally take 4 samples.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.560
So my sample is
made up of 4 samples

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.270
from this original
crazy distribution.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.070
Let's say I get a 1,
a 1, and a 6 and a 6.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:18.579
And so my third sample mean
is going to be 1 plus 1 is 2.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.264
2 plus 6 is 8.

00:04:20.264 --> 00:04:21.329
8 plus 6 is 14.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:29.900
14 divided by 4 is 3 and 1/2.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.130
And as I find each
of these sample

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.450
means-- so for each of my
samples of sample size 4,

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.598
I figure out a mean.

00:04:36.598 --> 00:04:38.056
And as I do each
of them, I'm going

00:04:38.056 --> 00:04:40.910
to plot it on a
frequency distribution.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.130
And this is all going to
amaze you in a few seconds.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.540
So I plot this all on a
frequency distribution.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.000
So I say, OK, on
my first sample,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.330
my first sample mean was 2.75.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.680
So I'm plotting the actual
frequency of the sample

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.940
means I get for each sample.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.537
So 2.75, I got it one time.

00:04:58.537 --> 00:04:59.870
So I'll put a little plot there.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.060
So that's from that
one right there.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.840
And the next time,
I also got a 2.75.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.390
That's a 2.75 there.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.200
So I got it twice.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.192
So I'll plot the
frequency right there.

00:05:10.192 --> 00:05:11.150
Then I got a 3 and 1/2.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.630
So all the possible values,
I could have a three,

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.960
I could have a 3.25, I
could have a 3 and 1/2.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.439
So then I have the 3 and 1/2,
so I'll plot it right there.

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:20.980
And what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.550
to keep taking these samples.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.130
Maybe I'll take 10,000 of them.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.000
So I'm going to keep
taking these samples.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.840
So I go all the way to S 10,000.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.270
I just do a bunch of these.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.980
And what it's going to look like
over time is each of these--

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.604
I'm going to make it
a dot, because I'm

00:05:35.604 --> 00:05:37.350
going to have to zoom out.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.170
So if I look at it like
this, over time-- it still

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.410
has all the values that it
might be able to take on,

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.590
2.75 might be here.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.110
So this first dot is
going to be-- this one

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.050
right here is going
to be right there.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.900
And that second one is
going to be right there.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.320
Then that one at 3.5 is
going to look right there.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.820
But I'm going to
do it 10,000 times.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.100
Because I'm going
to have 10,000 dots.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.599
And let's say as I do it, I'm
going just keep plotting them.

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:04.410
I'm just going to keep
plotting the frequencies.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.910
I'm just going to
keep plotting them

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.080
over and over and over again.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.830
And what you're going
to see is, as I take

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.500
many, many samples
of size 4, I'm

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.000
going to have
something that's going

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.220
to start kind of approximating
a normal distribution.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.580
So each of these dots represent
an incidence of a sample mean.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.670
So as I keep adding on
this column right here,

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.710
that means I kept getting
the sample mean 2.75.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:28.670
So over time.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.086
I'm going to have
something that's

00:06:30.086 --> 00:06:32.940
starting to approximate
a normal distribution.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.960
And that is a neat thing about
the central limit theorem.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.210
So an orange, that's the
case for n is equal to 4.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.390
This was a sample size of 4.

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.030
Now, if I did the same thing
with a sample size of maybe

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.950
20-- so in this case, instead
of just taking 4 samples

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.210
from my original crazy
distribution, every sample

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.380
I take 20 instances
of my random variable,

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.160
and I average those 20.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.774
And then I plot the
sample mean on here.

00:07:02.774 --> 00:07:04.190
So in that case,
I'm going to have

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.810
a distribution that
looks like this.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.710
And we'll discuss
this in more videos.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.380
But it turns out if I were
to plot 10,000 of the sample

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.150
means here, I'm going
to have something

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.610
that, two things-- it's going
to even more closely approximate

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:18.527
a normal distribution.

00:07:18.527 --> 00:07:20.193
And we're going to
see in future videos,

00:07:20.193 --> 00:07:22.250
it's actually going to
have a smaller-- well,

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.240
let me be clear.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.809
It's going to have
the same mean.

00:07:25.809 --> 00:07:26.600
So that's the mean.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.840
This is going to
have the same mean.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.952
So it's going to have a
smaller standard deviation.

00:07:31.952 --> 00:07:33.660
Well, I should plot
these from the bottom

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.590
because you kind of stack it.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:37.090
One you get one, then another
instance and another instance.

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.980
But this is going to
more and more approach

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.460
a normal distribution.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.930
So this is what's super
cool about the central limit

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:45.540
theorem.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:53.080
As your sample size
becomes larger--

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.080
or you could even say as
it approaches infinity.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.410
But you really don't
have to get that close

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.790
to infinity to really get
close to a normal distribution.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.380
Even if you have a
sample size of 10 or 20,

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.360
you're already getting very
close to a normal distribution,

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.060
in fact about as
good an approximation

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.850
as we see in our everyday life.

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:11.740
But what's cool is we can start
with some crazy distribution.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.121
This has nothing to do
with a normal distribution.

00:08:15.121 --> 00:08:17.370
This was n equals 4, but if
we have a sample size of n

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:19.910
equals 10 or n
equals 100, and we

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.477
were to take 100 of these,
instead of four here,

00:08:22.477 --> 00:08:24.310
and average them and
then plot that average,

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.060
the frequency of it, then we
take 100 again, average them,

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.910
take the mean, plot
that again, and if we

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.395
do that a bunch
of times, in fact,

00:08:30.395 --> 00:08:32.020
if we were to do that
an infinite time,

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.394
we would find that
we, especially

00:08:33.394 --> 00:08:35.210
if we had an
infinite sample size,

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.909
we would find a perfect
normal distribution.

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:39.419
That's the crazy thing.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:42.409
And it doesn't apply just
to taking the sample mean.

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:44.285
Here we took the
sample mean every time.

00:08:44.285 --> 00:08:46.160
But you could have also
taken the sample sum.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.890
The central limit theorem
would have still applied.

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.100
But that's what's so
super useful about it.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.300
Because in life, there's all
sorts of processes out there,

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.010
proteins bumping into
each other, people doing

00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:00.822
crazy things, humans
interacting in weird ways.

00:09:00.822 --> 00:09:02.780
And you don't know the
probability distribution

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.364
functions for any
of those things.

00:09:04.364 --> 00:09:05.780
But what the central
limit theorem

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.640
tells us is if we add a
bunch of those actions

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.400
together, assuming that they
all have the same distribution,

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.650
or if we were to take the
mean of all of those actions

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:16.930
together, and if we were to plot
the frequency of those means,

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:18.890
we do get a normal distribution.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:22.120
And that's frankly why the
normal distribution shows up

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.790
so much in statistics
and why, frankly, it's

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:28.330
a very good
approximation for the sum

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:31.460
or the means of a
lot of processes.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.931
Normal distribution.

00:09:33.931 --> 00:09:36.430
What I'm going to show you in
the next video is I'm actually

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.013
going to show you that this is
a reality, that as you increase

00:09:39.013 --> 00:09:41.360
your sample size, as
you increase your n,

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.180
and as you take a
lot of sample means,

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.980
you're going to have a frequency
plot that looks very, very

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.490
close to a normal distribution.
